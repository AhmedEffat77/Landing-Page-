            <h2>Why AlAhly !!!</h2>
            <p>The idea of establishing Al Ahly in the first decade of the 20th century was raised by Omar Lotfy during his presidency of the High School Students Club which was established in 1905. The establishment of the club of high school students was for political reasons, and found that these students needed a sports club that gathers them for leisure and exercise. He discussed the idea of establishing the club with a group of friends who were enthusiastic about it, and in 1907 Al Ahly was established.[5].</p>
            <p>The club was first headed by Mitchell-Innes, who was a British advisor to the Ministry of Finance at the time, in order to facilitate financial support for the club. An official meeting of the club's board was held on 24 April 1907. The committee met at 5:30 pm in the house of Mitchell-Innes in Giza under his chairmanship and the membership of Idris Ragheb Bey, Ismael Seri Pasha, Amin Sami Pasha, Omar Lotfi Bek and Mohamed Effendi Sherif as secretary</p>

            <p>After Al Ahly refused to compete with foreign Allied clubs in the Sultan Hussein Cup in its first edition in 1917, the club's management decided to participate in the 1918 championship.[13] In 1923, Al-Ahly won the Sultan Hussain Cup after beating the defending champion Zamalek, then added 6 other titles to be the record holder in the number of wins until the last edition in 1938</p>
            <p>After one year of winning the Sultan Hussain Cup, Al Ahly won the King Farouk Cup in 1924 for the first time after defeating El Sekka El Hadid 4–1. The man of the match was Mokhtar Eltetsh, who scored two goals</p>
